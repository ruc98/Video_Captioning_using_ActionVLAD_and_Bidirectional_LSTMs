# Download NUS-WIDE raw image

## Requirements

- skimage
- numpy
- ImageURLs.txt

Note that I only tested in python3 (maybe with some tweaks it will run in python2).

## How to run

```
python3 download_nus_wide.py
```

There are some options you can give, see more info with,

```
python3 download_nus_wide.py --help
```

## Note

NUS-WIDE dataset has 269,948 images but with this downloader it can get only 221,166 raw images.
